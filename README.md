`dxss` provides DOLFINx solvers on space-time finite element spaces which use a partition of the time interval to decompose the spatio-temporal domain into a collection of _time slabs_.

This project is developed in collaboration with the [Centre for Advanced Research Computing](https://ucl.ac.uk/arc), University College London.

([arc.collaborations@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:arc.collaborations@ucl.ac.uk))

## Built with

- [FEniCSx](https://fenicsproject.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Compatible with Python 3.9 and 3.10. [Requires DOLFINx v0.6.0 or above to be installed](https://github.com/FEniCS/dolfinx#installation).

### Installation

To install the latest development using `pip` run

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/UCL/dxss.git
```

Alternatively create a local clone of the repository with

```sh
git clone https://github.com/UCL/dxss.git
```

and then install in editable mode by running

```sh
pip install -e .
```

from the root of your clone of the repository.

### Running tests

Tests can be run across all compatible Python versions in isolated environments using
[`tox`](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/) by running

```sh
tox
```

from the root of the repository, or to run tests with Python 3.9 specifically run

```sh
tox -e test-py39
```

substituting `py39` for `py310` to run tests with Python 3.10.

To run tests manually in a Python environment with `pytest` installed run

```sh
pytest tests
```

again from the root of the repository.

### Building documentation

HTML documentation can be built locally using `tox` by running

```sh
tox -e docs
```

from the root of the repository with the output being written to `docs/_build/html`.
